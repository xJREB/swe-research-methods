abstract = {In recent years the development of highly interactive software systems with graphical user inter{\$}aces has become increasingly common. The acceptance of such a system depends to a large degree on the quality of its user interface. Prototyping is an excellent means for generating ideas about how a user inteflace can be designed, and it helps to evaluate the quality of a solution at an early stage. In this paper we present the basic concepts behind user inte flace prototyping, a classijication of tools supporting it and a case study of nine major industrial projects. Based on our analysis of these projects we present the following conclusions: Prototyping is used more consciously than in recent years. No project applied a traditional Eife-cycle approach, which is one of the reasons why most of them were successful. Prototypes are increasingly used as a vehicle for developing and demonstrating visions of innovative systems.},

@article{Ko2015,
abstract = {Empirical studies, often in the form of controlled experiments, have been widely adopted in software engineering research as a way to evaluate the merits of new software engineering tools. However, controlled experiments involving human participants actually using new tools are still rare, and when they are conducted, some have serious validity concerns. Recent research has also shown that many software engineering researchers view this form of tool evaluation as too risky and too difficult to conduct, as they might ultimately lead to inconclusive or negative results. In this paper, we aim both to help researchers minimize the risks of this form of tool evaluation, and to increase their quality, by offering practical methodological guidance on designing and running controlled experiments with developers. Our guidance fills gaps in the empirical literature by explaining, from a practical perspective, options in the recruitment and selection of human participants, informed consent, experimental procedures, demographic measurements, group assignment, training, the selecting and design of tasks, the measurement of common outcome variables such as success and time on task, and study debriefing. Throughout, we situate this guidance in the results of a new systematic review of the tool evaluations that were published in over 1,700 software engineering papers published from 2001 to 2011.},

@article{Naumann1982,
abstract = {Leading MIS executives and academicians have identified systems development as one of the most critical issues of the 1980s. Their concerns include providing user accessibility to stored information, reducing development cost and delay, increasing developer productivity, and increasing MIS's impact on organizational growth, productivity, and profitability. Among the number of proposed alternative approaches to traditional systems development, prototyping is mentioned frequently. Prototyping is routine in hardware development but not software. The authors review published references to prototyping and related concepts, and synthesize a process model for information systems. In this model, resource requirements are enumerated and discussed. The article includes an analysis of the economics of prototyping, and a brief discussion of several examples. Prototyping for information systems development addresses today's critical issues; it will no doubt raise a new set of research questions for tomorrow.},

abstract = {Recognition the needs and acceptance of individuals is the beginning stage of any businesses and this understanding would be helpful to find the way of future development, thus academicians are interested to realize the factors that drive users' acceptance or rejection of technologies. A number of models and frameworks have been developed to explain user adoption of new technologies and these models introduce factors that can affect the user acceptance. In this paper, an overview of theories and models regarding user acceptance of technology has been provided. The existing review will emphasize literature that tries to show how developers and researchers presage the level of admission any information technology will attain.},
