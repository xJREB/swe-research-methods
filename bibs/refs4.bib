abstract = {Background: A mapping study provides a systematic and objective procedure for identifying the nature and extent of the empirical study data that is available to answer a particular research question. Such studies can also form a useful preliminary step for PhD study. Aim: We set out to assess how effective such studies have been when used for software engineering topics, and to identify the specific challenges that they present. Method: We have conducted an informal review of a number of mapping studies in software engineering, describing their main characteristics and the forms of analysis employed. Results: We examine the experiences and outcomes from six mapping studies, of which four are published. From these we note a recurring theme about the problems of classification and a preponderance of ‘gaps' in the set of empirical studies. Conclusions: We identify our challenges as improving classification guidelines, encouraging better reporting of primary studies, and argue for identifying some 'empirical grand challenges' for software engineering as a focus for the community.},

abstract = {Literature reviews play an important role in a researcher's preparation of research problem. In order to find out a gap between what we already know and what we like to know, a researcher can utilize not only concepts (Webster and Watson 2002) but also classifications in performing literature review. It is assumed that a higher order framework can be unpacked into classifications. A classification consists of classes of a dimension, and classes can be concepts (variables). It will be shown that it is possible to derive some guidelines how to improve classifications for identifying research gaps in literature review.},

abstract = {Background: In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference. Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

abstract = {Context Systematic mapping studies are used to structure a research area, while systematic reviews are focused on gathering and synthesizing evidence. The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines. Objective To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly. Method We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment). Results In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given. Conclusion The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies. New guidelines have been proposed consolidating existing findings.},

abstract = {The literature review is an established research genre in many academic disciplines, including the IS discipline. Although many scholars agree that systematic literature reviews should be rigorous, few instructional texts for compiling a solid literature review, at least with regard to the IS discipline, exist. In response to this shortage, in this tutorial, I provide practical guidance for both students and researchers in the IS community who want to methodologically conduct qualitative literature reviews. The tutorial differs from other instructional texts in two regards. First, in contrast to most textbooks, I cover not only searching and synthesizing the literature but also the challenging tasks of framing the literature review, interpreting research findings, and proposing research paths. Second, I draw on other texts that provide guidelines for writing literature reviews in the IS discipline but use many examples of published literature reviews. I use an integrated example of a literature review, which guides the reader through the overall process of compiling a literature review. Keywords:},

abstract = {Literature reviews play an important role in the development of knowledge. Yet, we observe a lack of theoretical underpinning of and epistemological insights into how literature reviews can contribute to knowledge creation and have actually contributed in the IS discipline. To address these theoretical and empirical research gaps, we suggest a novel epistemological model of literature reviews. This model allows us to align different contributions of literature reviews with their underlying knowledge conversions - thereby building a bridge between the previously largely unconnected fields of literature reviews and epistemology. We evaluate the appropriateness of the model by conducting an empirical analysis of 173 IS literature reviews which were published in 39 pertinent IS journals between 2000 and 2014. Based on this analysis, we derive an epistemological taxonomy of IS literature reviews, which complements previously suggested typologies.},

@inproceedings{Zhou2016a,
abstract = {—Context: The assessment of Threats to Validity (TTVs) is critical to secure the quality of empirical studies in Software Engineering (SE). In the recent decade, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was becoming an increasingly important empirical research method in SE as it was able to provide the strongest evidence. One of the mechanisms of insuring the level of scientific value in the findings of an SLR is to rigorously assess its validity. Hence, it is necessary to realize the status quo and issues of TTVs of SLRs in SE. Objective: This study aims to investigate the-state-of-the-practice of TTVs of the SLRs published in SE, and further support SE researchers to improve the assessment and strategies against TTVs in order to increase the quality of SLRs in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study by reviewing the SLRs in SE that report the assessment of TTVs. Results: We identified 316 SLRs published from 2004 to the first half of 2015, in which TTVs are discussed. The issues associated to TTVs were also summarized and categorized. Conclusion: The common TTVs related to SLR research, such as internal validity and reliability, were thoroughly discussed in most SLRs. The threats to construct validity and external validity drew less attention. Moreover, there are few strategies and tactics being reported to cope with the various TTVs.},
